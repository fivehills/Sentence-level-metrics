# Sentence-relevance-and-sentence-surprisal

## Use Multilingual LLMs to realize the computation for sentence-level metrics

## The sentence-surprisal script:
is to compute sentence-level surprisal for mutiple language. The basic methods are relying on chain rule and negative log-likelihood from word probablity.

## The sentence-revelance scipt:
can be used to compute sentence-level semantic relevance for a given sentence for the context in multilingual situation.

## Both sentence-level metrics computed by the scripts could predict the reading rate for various languages.
